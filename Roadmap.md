2. Publishes **versions, changelogs, update channels**, and exposes **update/activation APIs**
3. Includes a **Client Portal** (purchases, licenses, activations, updates, support, projects, docs)
4. Provides **Customization Services** (catalog + RFQ flow → lead → draft quote)
5. Implements a **Lead & Sales Funnel** (wizard, quotes, invoices, payments, Kanban pipeline, meetings)
6. Ships with a **Marketing CMS** (landing, services, blog, case studies, FAQs, SEO)
7. Is secure, tested, SEO‑optimized, and deployable with CI/CD

## Routing & Architecture

**Public:**

* `/` (Landing), `/erp`, `/modules`, `/products/{slug}`, `/services`, `/services/{slug}`, `/blog`, `/blog/{slug}`, `/case-studies/{slug}`, `/pricing`, `/faq`, `/contact`, `/quote`, `/project-brief`
* Forms: `POST /contact`, `POST /quote`, `POST /project-brief/*`, `POST /services/{slug}/request`

**Portal (Client):**

* `/portal` (dashboard), `/portal/purchases`, `/portal/licenses`, `/portal/downloads`, `/portal/quotes/*`, `/portal/invoices/*`, `/portal/tickets/*`, `/portal/projects/*`, `/portal/docs/*`

**Admin:**

* `/admin` dashboard; resources for pages, posts, products, releases, orders, invoices, licenses, leads, quotes, tickets, projects, services, settings, users/roles/permissions, activity logs.

**APIs (Sanctum):**

* **Update API:** `GET /api/v1/products/{slug}/latest?license=...&channel=...&version=...` → latest compatible release + signed URL + checksum + release notes.
* **Activation API:** `POST /api/v1/licenses/activate` (license, domain, fingerprint) → activation token; enforce rate limits and audit.
* **Webhooks (outbound config):** `release.published`, `license.expiring`, `order.completed`, `ticket.updated`.

**Architecture Notes:**

* Controllers: resourceful; FormRequests for validation; Policies for ownership/security.
* Repos/QueryBuilders for complex reads; Events/Listeners for lifecycle (LeadCreated, QuoteApproved, InvoicePaid, ReleasePublished).
* Jobs/Queues for emails, PDF generation, file signing, webhook retries.
* ViewModels (optional) for complex page assembly.

---

## UX/UI (Tailwind + Alpine)

* **Storefront:** product grid with filters (ERP, module, category, pricing), badges (New, On Sale, EOL, Security Fix), sticky purchase panel on product page, tabs (Overview | Changelog | Compatibility | FAQ).
* **Release/Changelog UI:** filter by channel & version range; “What’s new” modal; RSS link.
* **Checkout:** multi‑step (account → billing → payment → confirm), coupon, tax ID, order summary.
* **Licenses:** masked key + copy button, activation table with revoke/rotate actions.
* **Kanban:** drag & drop leads between PipelineStages (Alpine sortable), logs changes.
* **Wizard:** progress bar, per‑step server validation, resumable.
* **Tickets & Projects:** clean tables, filters, attachments preview, discussion thread with uploads.
* **Docs/KB:** left nav tree, search, version switcher, code blocks; “last updated” stamp.
* **Global:** responsive, accessible (WCAG AA), dark mode toggle (persisted), toasts/modals/skeletons via Alpine.

---

## Emails, PDFs, and Notifications

* **Emails:** branded Markdown templates: lead received, quote sent/approved/rejected, invoice due/paid, ticket reply, new release available, license expiring.
* **PDFs:** Quotes and Invoices with branding, QR code (optional), terms.
* **Notifications:** DB + email; user preferences; digest for releases (optional).

---

## Security, Compliance, and Observability

* **Security:** CSRF, rate limit activations/update checks/downloads, signed artifact URLs, checksum verification, password rules, 2FA optional, email verification, role policies.
* **Audit:** activity log for admin actions, downloads, activations, stage changes, license rotations.
* **Backups:** daily DB + weekly full via spatie/laravel-backup.
* **Logging/Monitoring:** Horizon dashboard, queue failure notifications, webhook retries with DLQ.

---

## Performance

* Route/view/config caching; tagged caches for catalog fragments and changelogs.
* Eager loading, pagination defaults; image optimization & WebP; lazy load images.
* Queue heavy tasks (PDFs, signatures, zips, emails). Lighthouse ≥ 90 across Perf/SEO/BP/A11y.

---

## Deliverables

* Full Laravel repo with Docker, Makefile, `.env.example`, `README.md` (setup + deploy).
* Seeders for CMS content, catalog (ERP + modules), services/options/FAQs, releases/changelogs (stable + beta), example orders/licenses, KB/docs, case studies, demo leads/quotes/invoices, tickets, projects.
* Postman collection + OpenAPI (YAML/JSON) for public APIs.

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security & Compliance
- CSRF, XSS protection, strict validation with FormRequests
- Role-based access (spatie/permission) + Policies on sensitive resources
- Signed URLs for downloads; verify checksums; rate-limit critical endpoints
- Activity/audit logs for admin actions, downloads, activations, stage changes, license rotations
- EULA acceptance tracking; refund rules documented

### Observability
- Horizon dashboard; queue failure notifications
- Webhook retry strategy with exponential backoff + DLQ
- App & access logs with structured context (order, license, release IDs)

### Backups & DR
- Daily DB, weekly full; encrypt; offsite retention policy
- Quarterly restore drills; runbook documented

### Performance
- Tagged caches for product & changelog fragments
- Eager loaded relations on listing pages
- Asset minification; HTTP caching hints; image WebP pipeline

---

## Versioning & Release Cadence

- **SemVer** for app and products/modules
- Branch strategy:
  - `main` (stable), `develop` (next), feature branches `feat/*`, releases `release/*`, hotfixes `hotfix/*`
- Release train:
  - **Patch**: weekly (bugfixes, docs)
  - **Minor**: bi‑weekly (features behind flags)
  - **Major**: quarterly (breaking changes)
- Changelog format: Keep a CHANGELOG.md per package/product + global app changelog
- Tags: `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, etc., with GitHub Releases + release notes

---

## Risk Register (Top)

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Payment webhook mismatch | High | Med | Integration tests + webhook signature verification + idempotency keys |
| License key leakage | High | Low | Key masking in UI, rotation, rate limits, anomaly detection |
| Slow product pages | Med | Med | Cache fragments, eager loading, image optimization |
| Queue backlog | Med | Med | Horizon autoscaling, retry backoff, DLQ |
| Changelog/update errors | Med | Low | Pre-publish validation, checksum/signature CI step |
| SEO regressions | Med | Low | Lighthouse CI, sitemap tests, canonical checks |

---

## KPIs & Success Metrics

- Conversion rate (catalog → checkout start → purchase)
- Payment success %, refund rate
- Time-to-first-download post-purchase
- License activation success rate; activation retries
- Lead-to-won conversion; average sales cycle time
- Ticket first-response time; resolution time
